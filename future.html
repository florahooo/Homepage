                <h3>CS50 Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    CS50 definitely opened my eyes towards all things computer science. Before, I didn’t even know what a data structure was, or what command line arguments were or even how IP addresses work! CS50 definitely made me a more appreciative person, just knowing how much work went into creating some of the most spectacular pieces of technology we see today. 
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    The course so far has definitely not been easy for me, and I had many frustrating nights trying to  understand many of the topics. But, I’m definitely thankful for what CS50 gave me, not only the knowledge but also the mindset. I learned how to approach problems, and how to be (very) patient when things aren’t going your way. I learned to not cry or burst into anger when nothing seems to work, and finally, I learned to talk to a rubber duck when you’re in dire situations. Even if I don’t go into programming/computer science in the future, the mindset that I left with is definitely one of my most valuable things I’ve ever taken from a course.

                <h3>So...What am I doing after CS50?</h3>
                <p>
                    Technically...I’m not done the course yet (whoopsies!), I still have many many problems to do, but after CS50, I’m hoping to apply my knowledge and continue growing from the ladder CS50 set me up with. I’ve found that I really enjoy web development! It’s super fun to see your designs come to life, and javascript is great (if you can execute it correctly ;-;). After this, I wanna continue learning, and hopefully learn a web framework such as React,  Angular or Vue. I may also take CS50 for web development we’ll seeeeeeee. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I really want to create a full-fledged web application with a full on user login system using front-end, back-end and databases.  My current idea is to build a full-fledged productivity app, that includes a lot of the most popular productivity apps into one.  I also just want to get better at all the languages I currently know. I’ll definitely be sharpening up my python skills (I don’t know about C tho, pretty sure its a lost cause) and I’ll  continue creating programs that make me happy, or are just for fun!
